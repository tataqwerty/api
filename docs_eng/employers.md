## Company search

`GET /employers` will return the company search results.

Additional available parameters:

* text – text field, sent value is searched in the name and description of the company.
* area – employer ID, multiple parameter. You can find region ID in the [directory of regions](areas.md)
* type – type of employer, multiple parameter. Allowed values — keys in the [directory `employer_type`](dictionaries.md)
* only_with_vacancies – return only employers who have open vacancies at the moment (`true`) or all employers (`false`).
                        Default — `false`.
* page – number of page with employers (counted up from 0, default is 0)
* per_page – number of elements on page (default — 20)

For page parameters (`page`, `per_page`) there is a limit:
the depth of returned results cannot exceed 2000. For example, a request `per_page=10&page=199` 
(search results from 1991 to 2000 companies) is possible, but a request with `per_page=10&page=200` 
will return an error (results from 2001 to 2010 companies).

    "id": "1455",
    "site_url": "https://hh.ru",
    "description": "...",

}
```

`branded_description` – a string with the HTML code (`<script/>` and `<style/>`
presence is possible), which is an alternative to the standard company
description. HTML is adapted for mobile devices and is displayed correctly
without any javascript support. At that:

* Content width extends for 100% of the container width and is fit in 300px
  without any scrolling.
* Content is intended to be put in a binding that consists of the name, logo,
  website and a link to the company's vacancies.
* Images that can be found in such a description are adapted for retina
  displays.
* Font size is no less than 12px, line spacing is no less than 16px.

The value can be null, if the company doesn't have an individual description.

`vacancies_url` – a link to the search results of the company's vacancies.

`logo_urls` – company logo images of different sizes.

`original` – an unedited logo, which can be big in size. If the originally
uploaded logo is smaller than 240px and/or 90px in its smaller side,
the corresponding keys will have links to the original images. Object
can be null, if the company hasn't uploaded its logo. The client should foresee
the possibility of the logo missing in the indicated link (response with the
`404 Not Found` code).

`type` – type of company (immediate employer, HR agency, etc).
         Possible values are described in [collection of directories](dictionaries.md) under
         the key `employer_type`. `null` is possible if the company type is hidden.

`area` — region of employer.

`trusted` — the flag indicates that [the company is verified by the website](https://feedback.hh.ru/article/details/id/5951).
